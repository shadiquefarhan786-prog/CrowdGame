# CrowdPlay: Real-Time Multiplayer Synthwave Jigsaw Puzzle

Welcome to **CrowdPlay**, a real-time, mobile-controlled multiplayer jigsaw puzzle game built with Node.js, Express, and Socket.io. 

CrowdPlay is designed to run in a hybrid environment: a **Big Screen View** (e.g., a TV or projector) displays the shared puzzle board, while players connect using their **Mobile Controllers** via a simple 4-character room code to drag, drop, and snap puzzle pieces into place in real time.

## 🎮 How It Works

    end

    Mobile <-->|Socket: join-room / place-piece| NodeApp
    Admin <-->|REST & Socket: admin-start-activity| NodeApp

    JigsawAct <-->|File operations & Fallbacks| S3Bucket
    RoomMgr <-->|Sync room state| Cache
    RoomMgr <-->|Save rooms / participants| DB
```

1. **Host Setup**: The host opens the **Big Screen View** at `/screen/DEMO` (or any generated room code). This establishes a Socket.io host connection.
2. **Player Joins**: Players scan a QR code or visit `/join/[ROOM_CODE]`, enter their name, and get assigned a unique neon color.
3. **Admin Launch**: The administrator uses the `/admin` dashboard to select a puzzle image (or upload one), configure the grid dimensions (rows/columns), and start the activity.
4. **Gameplay**:
   - The server uses the `sharp` library to slice the chosen image into grid pieces.
   - The server assigns pieces to active players (up to 2 at a time).
   - Players drag and drop pieces on their phone. Drag coordinates are synced live to the Big Screen.
   - When a player drops a piece near its correct coordinates, it snaps into place, awards points, and gives the player new pieces until the puzzle is completed.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Development)

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: `v14.0.0` or higher is required.
- **System Dependencies**: The `sharp` image-processing library compiles native binaries. Ensure your system tools are up to date.

### 2. Installation
Install dependencies in the root directory:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Server
Launch the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. First-Time Local Playthrough
After `npm run dev` is running, keep that terminal open and use the URLs below.

#### Host / Big Screen
Open this on the computer, TV, or projector that will show the shared puzzle board:
```text
https://localhost:3000/screen/DEMO
```

This screen shows the room code and the shared puzzle board. Leave it open while people play.

#### Admin
Open this in another browser tab:
```text
https://localhost:3000/admin
```

Log in with the admin password. In local development, the default is:
```text
admin123
```

Then:
1. Choose or upload a puzzle image.
2. Set the puzzle rows and columns.
3. Start the activity for room `DEMO`.

#### Players
Players should join from their phones using the same room code:
```text
https://<YOUR_LOCAL_IP>:3000/join/DEMO
```

Replace `<YOUR_LOCAL_IP>` with the IP address of the computer running the server, for example:
```text
https://192.168.1.5:3000/join/DEMO
```

Each player should:
1. Open the join URL on their phone.
2. Accept the browser warning for the self-signed development certificate.
3. Enter their name.
4. Use the phone screen to drag and drop assigned puzzle pieces.

For a quick local test on the same computer, you can also open:
```text
https://localhost:3000/join/DEMO
```

## 🔒 Crucial Dev Detail: SSL/HTTPS
Mobile browsers block access to **Device Orientation API** (gyroscope/accelerometer) and other interactive touch gestures when running over unencrypted HTTP (except on `localhost`).

To allow mobile devices on your local network to connect and function correctly:
- In **development** (`NODE_ENV` not set to `production`), the server generates dynamic, **self-signed SSL certificates** on the fly using `selfsigned` and launches an **HTTPS** server.
- The console will output:
  ```
  Running in DEVELOPMENT mode (Self-signed HTTPS server)...
  Access Admin Dashboard: https://localhost:3000/admin
  Access Screen view:     https://localhost:3000/screen/DEMO
  ```
- **To connect your phone**:
  1. Find your computer's local IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.5`).
  2. Navigate on your phone to `https://<YOUR_LOCAL_IP>:3000/join/DEMO`.
  3. Your browser will show a warning ("Your connection is not private"). Click **Advanced -> Proceed** to bypass the self-signed warning.

## ⚙️ Configuration & Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file or set the following variables in your environment:

| Variable | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `NODE_ENV` | Mode of operation (`development` or `production`) | `development` |
| `PORT` | The port the application listens on | `3000` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string. If omitted, falls back to SQLite | *None* |
| `USE_SQLITE_FALLBACK` | Set to `false` to disable SQLite database fallback | `true` |
| `SQLITE_PATH` | Path to the SQLite DB file | `../crowdplay.sqlite` |
| `REDIS_URL` | Redis URL. If omitted, falls back to an In-Memory mock client | *None* |
| `S3_BUCKET` | AWS S3 Bucket name for puzzle image storage | *None* |
| `AWS_REGION` | AWS Region for the S3 bucket | `us-east-1` |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | IAM credential key for S3 uploads | *None* |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | IAM credential secret for S3 uploads | *None* |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Password to log in to `/admin` | `admin123` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret key used to sign Admin JWT session tokens | `crowdplay-super-secret-key-change-in-prod` |

## ☁️ Production Deployment

In **production** (`NODE_ENV=production`):
- The Node.js application runs as a standard **HTTP** server (dynamic SSL generation is skipped for performance).
- SSL termination and HTTPS routing must be handled at the load-balancer level (e.g., AWS Application Load Balancer).
- A health-check endpoint is available at `/health` returning HTTP 200 (required for target groups).

### AWS ECS Fargate Deployment
A complete CloudFormation template is provided under [cloudformation.yaml](file:///Users/sachin/Documents/GitHub/Mobile_Game/infrastructure/aws/cloudformation.yaml) to provision:
1. An **ECS Cluster** running tasks on Fargate.
2. An **Application Load Balancer** with listener rules routing HTTPS traffic to HTTP container instances.
3. Integration support for an RDS PostgreSQL database instance and AWS ElastiCache Redis.
